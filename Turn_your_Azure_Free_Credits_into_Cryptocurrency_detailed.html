          Instructions</h1>
        <p>The rate can fluctuate between 1:1 and 1:4, i.e. in the best case
          you'll get almost 1$ worth of cryptocurrency for every 1$ spent on
          azure (depending on the current exchange-rates). This is possible
          because the newly introduced Azure-batch-service has a
          low-priority-option, which is dirt cheap!</p>
        Short summary:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You'll need a azure-account with free-credit, e.g. from a
              MSDN-subscription</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Chose a cryptonight-pool (or get a Nicehash.com-account)<br>
            </strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Start mining with the Azure-Batch-Service using the
              scripts provided here</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Setup Azure with Free Credit</h1>
        <p>Do you have a <strong>MSDN-subscription from you day job?</strong>
          Great! You must have already noticed that Microsoft keeps sending you
          emails asking you to open an azure-account with up to 150$ monthly
          credit. Follow the instructions in the mail to claim your free
          credits. <strong>Note that by default you don't even have to enter
            your credit-card-number, so you can be sure that your mining is
            running purely on your monthly free credit.</strong><br>
          <br>
          If you don't have a MSDN-subscription, you can at least use the <strong>one-time
            credit of 200$</strong> you get just for opening the Azure-account.
          Depending on the current exchange-rate and whether azure adds tax to
          you bill or not it might even be profitable to keep running your
          azure-account on your credit-card - but note that you'll be operating
          on a razor-thin margin!</p>
        <h1>Chose Cryptonight-Pool (or Setup Nicehash.com account)</h1>
        <p>With the scripts provided on this site you can mine with the <strong>cryptonight-algorithm</strong>.
          The cryptonight-algorithm can be efficiently run on standard hardware,
          special ASICs or GPUs are not required (the algorithm was
          intentionally designed that way). The cryptocurrency <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>
          is based on this algorithm, and it is better than bitcoin in virtually
          every aspect (i guess bitcoin beats Monero only in popularity...). <strong>You
            could mine directly to a <a href="https://moneropools.com/">Monero-pool</a>,
            but there are several other cryptocurrencies based on cryptonight
            available as well.</strong> When choosing a pool, pay attention to
          the pool's rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the pool's fees? This just means that your payout is
            decreased by the given percentage.</li>
          <li>What is the pool's minimum payout? Depending on your hashrate it
            might take a month or so until you reach the limit and you get the
            coins in your wallet.</li>
          <li>Reward method PPS or PPLNS? With PPLNS the miners get their share
            only once the pool finds a block, so for small pools it might take
            several days until you can see a non-zero pending balance for your
            wallet on the pool's website.</li>
          <li>You'll need to setup a wallet first. For Monero probably the
            easiest way to get started is <a href="https://mymonero.com/#/">mymonero.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>The alternative is to mine to a pool run by Nicehash.com</strong>
        (i recommend mining with Nicehash only if you have MSDN Enterprise).
        With <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/">Nicehash.com</a> you are
        basically always mining the most profitable altcoin and you get paid in
        bitcoin (read their <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/help/how-does-nicehash-work">documentation</a>
        to learn how it works internally). If you are using Nicehash.com you'll
        get a special internal wallet, which you can only use with Nicehash.com
        pools. You can sign up for a free account at <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/register">Nicehash.com/register</a>.
        <p>It's good practice to setup a secondary pool, in case the primary
          pool is offline. Personally i use Nicehash as a primary mining-pool
          and the Monero mining-pool <a href="https://web.xmrpool.eu/">xmrpool.eu</a>
          as a secondary mining-pool. </p>

            you can see the estimated daily income when mining with 16 cores</strong>
          (app. yield: 700H/s; the number of cores you can use depends on your
          MSDN-subscription) in the azure cloud. In my experience Nicehash
          always had the best or second-best profitability&nbsp; â†’ look at the
          "Nicehash-CryptoNight"-entry. It might not sound like much at first,
          but once you set it up it's free money :-)</p>
        <p>Note: Cryptocurrencies are notorious for being targets of spectacular
          hacks - even Nicehash.com was hacked once. <strong>The more
            cryptocurrency you accumulate, the more important it is to educate
            yourself about the possible security threats!</strong></p>
        <h1>Setup the Azure Batch-Service </h1>
        <p>Note: Azure calls a group of virtual machines within the
          batch-service a 'Pool'. This has nothing to do with the term
          'mining-pool' (operated by e.g. xmrpool.eu). Don't confuse the two
          terms.</p>
        <p>After signing up for your azure-account you can click on the
          following link to create a <strong>new batch-account</strong>: <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BatchAccount">https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BatchAccount</a>
          Fill the form with following information:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account name: Just a name for your batch-account</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Resource Group: Click 'Create New' and give it a name,
              e.g. 'myRecGroup'</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Leave the other options at the default-settings.</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Click on 'Create' at the bottom to create the
              batch-account</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you get the notification that your batch-account has been
          created (it will take a few seconds), go to your batch-account and <strong>create
            a new pool</strong>: select <strong>'Pools'</strong> and then click
          <strong>'Add'</strong>. Fill the form with the following information:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Section 'Pool Detail':</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>

          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on 'OK' at the bottom to create
              the azure-pool</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        In order to make the nodes actually do something, you'll need a startup
        script which downloads the mining-executable and starts mining. You can
        create your personalized script here by filling out the fields:
        <ul>
          <li>Primary mining-pool.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Wallet for primary mining-pool:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Your personal Monero-wallet. A random string of characters

          function of the script)</p>
        <p>Once the azure-pool is created, go to <strong>'Start task'</strong>.
          Fill the form with the following information:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Command line: here you have to enter your personalized

          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Click on 'Save'</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p> The last step is to tell Azure how many mining-nodes it should start
          for you. This depends on the amount of free credits available in your
          azure-account. <strong>Basically you want to use up as much of your
            monthly credit as possible without actually consuming all of your
            credit</strong> (otherwise you'll have to repeat the setup again in
          the next month because azure will delete your pools if your free
          credits are exhausted).</p>
        <table style="width: 744px; height: 104px;" border="1">
          <tbody>
            <tr>

          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>If azure is using your local currency instead of USD the numbers
          might look slightly different. If you run out of free credit before
          the end of the month, just reduce the number of nodes by one and try
          again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Now go back to 'Overview' and click on 'Scale'. Enter the
            number from the table above in the field 'Low priority nodes' (e.g.
            3 if you have MSDN Professional), and click on 'Save'.
            Congratulations! The azure cloud is now mining cryptocurrency for
            you!</strong></p>
        <p>If you have MSDN Enterprise you can also setup two azure-pools: One
          pool with a single F16-Node to mine to Nicehash, and a second pool
          with two F2-Nodes mining to xmrpool.eu (this will result in a total of
          20 active cores).</p>
        To stop your azure-pool, go to the overview-page of the azure-pool,
        select 'Scale' and enter '0' as the number of 'Low priority nodes'. Then
        click 'Save'. <strong>Note that by default your azure-pool will
          automatically stop when your free credits are exhausted</strong>. You
        can simply restart your azure-pool in the next month once your free
        credits have been refilled.
        <h1>Watching your Mining-Progress</h1>
        <p><strong>If you are using xmrpool.eu</strong> you can see your
          mining-status if you go to the pool's homepage (e.g. <a href="https://web.xmrpool.eu/">xmrpool.eu</a>),
          scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter your wallet (other
          mining-pools probably work similarly).</p>

          <li><strong>Approximately 5 minutes after starting your azure-pool you
              should be able to see the number of submitted hashes slowly
              increasing.</strong> The displayed hashrate will vary wildly -
            this is normal.</li>
          <li><strong>Your pending balance will increase once the mining-pool
              finds a new block.</strong> For a big pool like xmrpool.eu this
            will happen a few times per day. However, if the pool is unlucky, it
            can also take a day or two.</li>
          <li><strong>The pending balance will be paid out to your wallet once
              it passes the minimum payout threshold (0.2 XMR for xmrpool.eu).</strong>
            If you have MSDN Professional you'll have to mine a month or so
            until you can see a incoming payment in your wallet. Obviously it'll
            be faster if you have more azure-credits to spend.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>If you are mining with Nicehash.com</strong> you have to login
        and go to the dashboard to see the statistics. The Nicehash-servers use
        a very high difficulty-setting. This means:
        <ul>
          <li>While your miner will be visible a few minutes after starting up
            the azure-pool, it will show up with a hash-rate of 0. <strong>You
              have to let your azure-pool run for one hour or so to get
              meaningful statistics on the Nicehash.com website.</strong></li>
          <li>I do not recommend mining to Nicehash.com with nodes which have
            less than 16 cores. Otherwise the hashrate per node might get so low
            that Nicehash is banning individual nodes.</li>
          <li><strong>You are mining to an internal wallet which is not part of
              the bitcoin-blockchain</strong>. Read the <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/help/sellers">documentation</a>
            to see the different options and fees to transfer your balance to a
            real bitcoin wallet. </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Important Notes: </h1>
        <p> </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Azure has a standard-limit of 20 low-priority-cores per
              region</strong>. If the quota in your azure-account is less than
            that, you can request an increase of this quota through the azure
            support. I recommend not asking for more than 20 cores. We are
            operating in some kind of gray area here, you don't want to cause a
            big stir...<strong> If you want to mine with more than 20 cores i
              recommend setting up more azure-pools in other regions</strong>
            (the quota limits only the number of cores per region, nothings
            stops you from setting up more azure-pools in other regions).</li>
          <li><b>The script will restart itself every 2 days, fetching the
              latest version of the miner-executable from github.</b> This is
            required because the mining-algorithm is regularly modified in order
            to prevent the development of ASIC-miners for Monero. If you don't
            like this behaviour you can change the phrase '(./setup_vm.sh &amp;
            )' to '(./setup_vm.sh )' in the generated script (i.e. remove the
            '&amp;'-character). However, note that then you will have to
            manually restart your mining-pools in order to get the updated
            miner-software.<br>
            <strong></strong></li>
          <li><strong>Nothing in life is free.</strong> If you are mining with
            the script from this site the miner-executable will mine 4% of the
            time to my private wallet. From the cryptocurrency generated this
            way i pledge to donate half (2%) to the authors of xmr-stak. You can
            view this as a convenience-fee for getting a tested and streamlined
            mining-script.</li>
