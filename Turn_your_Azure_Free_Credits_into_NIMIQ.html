        <h1>How to Turn Your Azure Free Credits into NIMIQ (NIM)</h1>
        <p>The rate can fluctuate between 1:1 and 1:4, i.e. in the best case
          you'll get almost 1$ worth of cryptocurrency for every 1$ spent on
          azure (depending on the current exchange-rates). <strong>With an MSDN
            Enterprise subscription you can mine cryptocurrency worth up to 147$
            every month!</strong> This is possible because the newly introduced
          Azure-batch-service is dirt cheap!</p>
        Short summary:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You'll need a azure-account with free-credit, e.g. from a
              MSDN-subscription</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Get a NIMIQ-wallet</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Start mining with the Azure-Batch-Service using the
              scripts provided here</strong></li>
        </ul>
        With the instructions provided here you will be mining NIMIQ (NIM). <a
          href="https://nimiq.com/">NIMIQ</a> is the hot new browser-based
        cryptocurrency. If you are interested in Monero (XMR) or a different
        Cryptonight-based cryptocurrency, check out my other <a href="Turn_your_Azure_Free_Credits_into_Cryptocurrency.html">guide</a>.
        Even if you are interested only in NIMIQ you could still have a look at
        the guide because there's a video of the setup-procedure available
        there. <br>
        <h1>Setup Azure with Free Credit</h1>
        <p>Do you have a <strong>MSDN-subscription from your day job?</strong>
          Great! You must have already noticed that Microsoft keeps sending you
          emails asking you to open an azure-account with up to 150$ monthly
          credit. Follow the instructions in the mail to claim your free
          credits. <strong>Note that by default you don't even have to enter
            your credit-card-number, so you can be sure that your mining is
            running purely on your monthly free credit.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Even if your company pays for the MSDN-subscription, the
            associated azure-account is your personal account and completely
            separated from the company.</strong> Your boss has no way of
          accessing it. Microsoft encourages people to use the free credits for
          testing and learning, and this is what you'll do: learning about using
          the azure-cloud and the blockchain-technology in a very practical way
          :-)</p>
        <h1>Get a NIM-Wallet</h1>
        <p>Create your NIM-wallet at the official NIMIQ-site: <a href="https://safe.nimiq.com/#">safe.nimiq.com</a>.
          Do it the right way and store your secret words in a <strong>password-safe
            like <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/"> keepass</a>. Trust me,
            you'll regret it otherwise. <br>
          </strong></p>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are notorious for being targets of spectacular hacks
          and scams. Don't enter your login-details on a phishing site (check
          your browser's address bar to make sure that you are really on
          safe.nimiq.com before entering your password!).<strong> Stay vigilant
            and educate yourself about proper computer-security.</strong><strong></strong><br>
          <strong> </strong> </p>
        <h1>Setup the Azure Batch-Service </h1>
        <p>After signing up for your azure-account you can click on the
          following link to create a <strong>new batch-account</strong>: <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BatchAccount">https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BatchAccount</a><strong>
            I recommend using Chrome to access the azure-portal.</strong> Fill
          the form with the following information:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Resource Group: Click 'Create New' and give it a name,
              e.g. 'myRecGroup'</strong><br>
            <strong></strong></li>
          <li><strong>Account name: Just a name for your batch-account</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Location: Choose 'South Central US'</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Leave the other options at the default-settings.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>
              <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
              <strong>Click on 'Review+Create' at the bottom and then on
                'Create" on the following page to create the batch-account</strong></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p> Once you get the notification that your batch-account has been
          created (it will take a few seconds), go to your batch-account (link
          to your batch-accounts: <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Batch%2FbatchAccounts">https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Batch%2FbatchAccounts</a>)
          and <strong>create a new pool</strong>: select <strong>'Pools'</strong>
          and then click <strong>'Add'</strong>. Fill the form with the
          following information:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Section 'Pool Detail':</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pool ID: Just a name for your azure-pool</strong></li>
            <li><strong>VM Size: 'Standard F4s_v2 (4 Cores, 8GB)'<br>
              </strong>(Choose the exact type! Otherwise you will not get the
              optimal hashrate!)<strong></strong></li>
          </ul>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 'Operating System':</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Publisher: Canonical</strong></li>
            <li><strong>SKU: 16-04 LTS</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <strong></strong><strong></strong>
          <li><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave the other options at the
              default-settings.</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on 'OK' at the bottom to create
              the azure-pool</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Whenever the computers in your azure-pool get started up, they will
          execute a custom script which will download the mining-executable and
          start mining. <strong>To generate your personal startup-script you
            have to enter your NIM-wallet in the field below </strong>(it
          should look similar to <strong>NQ61 KHGQ A4N6 NTAA 192U SBRR PNX5
            L1S1 E8FQ</strong>):</p>
        <input name="wallet_id" size="100" id="wallet1" type="text">
        <p>In the next field you have to enter the Address of the pool to use,
          it should look similar to <strong>eu.sushipool.com:443</strong>. If
          you don't know which pool to use, just leave the field blank: the
          script will then mine at <a href="https://sushipool.com">sushipool</a>.<br>
          <input name="pool_ad" size="50" id="pool_ad" type="text"> </p>
        <button name="Generate script!" value="Generate script!" type="button" onclick="assemblescript()">Generate
          script!</button><br>
        <p>Press the button above to generate your personalized script in the
          field below:</p>
        <textarea name="result" cols="100" rows="5" id="result"></textarea> <br>
        <br>
        <p>Once the azure-pool is created, go to <strong>'Start task'</strong>.
          Fill the form with the following information:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Command line: here you have to copy&amp;paste your
              personalized script from the textfield above</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>User identity: 'Task Autouser, Admin'</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Leave the other options at the default.</strong></li>
          <strong> </strong>
          <li><strong>Click on 'Save'</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p> The last step is to tell Azure how many mining-nodes it should start
          for you. This depends on the amount of free credits available in your
          azure-account. <strong>Basically you want to use up as much of your
            monthly credit as possible without actually consuming all of your
            credit</strong> (otherwise you'll have to repeat the setup again in
          the next month because azure will delete your pools if your free
          credits are exhausted).</p>
        <table style="width: 744px; height: 104px;" border="1">

        <ul>
          <li>If azure is using your local currency instead of USD the numbers
            might look slightly different. If you run out of free credit before
            the end of the month, just reduce the number of nodes by one and try
            again.</li>
          <li><b>With MSDN Professional you can actually afford another 2 cores.
              Just create another pool with a single F2s_V2-instance to get a

            3 instances won't work: this costs more than 50$ due to the way the
            storage is billed by azure)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Now go back to 'Overview' and click on 'Scale'. Enter the
            number from the table above in the field 'Low priority nodes' (e.g.

            Congratulations! The azure cloud is now mining NIMIQ for you!</strong></p>
        <h1>Watching your Mining-Progress</h1>
        <p>Unless you have entered a different address in the field the script
          will use <a href="https://sushipool.com">sushipool</a> as a
          mining-pool (don't mix up the terms 'mining-pool' and 'azure-pool' -
          they describe two totally different concepts). To see your
          mining-status, go to <a href="https://sushipool.com">sushipool.com</a>
          and enter your wallet in the field at the top of the site.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The VM takes around 5 minutes to startup and setup the
              mining-software. After that you will see your hashrate at the pool
              slowly increasing.</strong> The displayed hashrate will vary
            wildly - this is normal.</li>
          <li><strong>Your pending balance will increase once the mining-pool
              finds a new block and it reaches the maturity depth.</strong> For
            a big pool like sushipool this will take an hour or so. However, if
            the pool is unlucky, it can also take longer.</li>
          <li><strong>Each pool has different rules regarding payout. Sushipool
              will transfer your earnings every three hours with a minimum
              amount of 1 NIM.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Important Notes: </h1>
        <p> </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Some reasons why the hashrate displayed by the pool will
              vary a lot</strong>:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>In exchange for the low price azure does not guarantee 100%
              availability for the low-priority-VMs (in my experience the VMs
              are in fact available most of the time, though).</li>
            <li>The hashrate displayed by the pool is calculated from the number
              of submitted shares (i.e. shares which exceed the custom
              difficulty of the pool), not from the number of hashes your miner
              has actually calculated.<br>
              <strong></strong></li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>All in all you can expect around 6kH/s per used core, i.e.
              120kH/s for 20 cores if you have MSDN Enterprise.</strong></li>
          <ul>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Azure has a standard-limit of 20 low-priority-cores per
              region</strong>. If the quota in your azure-account is less than
            that, you can request an increase of this quota through the azure
            support. I recommend not asking for more than 20 cores. We are
            operating in some kind of gray area here, you don't want to cause a
            big stir...<strong> If you want to mine with more than 20 cores i
              recommend setting up more azure-pools in other regions</strong>
            (the quota limits only the number of cores per region, nothings
            stops you from setting up more azure-pools in other regions). Note
            that the the pricing for each region is different - for optimum
            profitability you need to choose a region with a low price for
            low-priority-batch-processing with F4s_v2-nodes and P4-type storage.</li>
          <li><b>The script will restart itself every few days and download the
              the latest version of the miner-executable.</b> This way you will
            automatically get updates for the miner as soon as they become
            available. It's not possible to keep the batch-script static anyway:
            Azure might restart your nodes at any time and then the script has
            to download and setup everything again. <br>
            <strong></strong></li>
          <li>The script is using the miner from <a href="https://miner.beeppool.org/">beeppool.org</a>.&nbsp;
            <br><strong></strong></li>
          <li><strong>Nothing in life is free.</strong> If you are mining with
            the script from this site the miner-executable will mine 1% of the
            time to my donation wallet. From the cryptocurrency generated this
            way i pledge to donate half (0.5%) to the authors of the
            mining-software. You can disable the donation by changing the phrase
            'donation=1' to 'donation=0' in the startup-script.</li>
